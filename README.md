Smart Home Project: 3S - Smart, Simple, Secure
This smart home project integrates sensors, automation, and remote monitoring to enhance comfort, safety, and energy efficiency. The system includes multiple sensors, such as PIR motion detectors, gas and flame sensors, and an ultrasonic water-level sensor. These are organized into security and comfort systems, with each sensorâ€™s function and action mapped out for seamless event handling.

The smart home setup features real-time notifications via the Blynk app, allowing users to respond promptly to events like motion detection, fire hazards, or water level changes. With a modern two-story design, this project highlights a user-friendly interface, efficient energy use with solar panels, and a responsive security setup.
